            <p>Zeta Phi Rho at UCSB aims to help out the surrounding community through a multitude of events including beach clean-ups, helping out at IV Elementary School, and hosting fundraisers for a local issue. Our most recent fundraiser went to a non-profit organization that provides sanitary supplies to those in need in order to decrease the spread of COVID-19. There are also chapter-wide philanthropies that the fraternity annually hosts such as “Zeta Phi Skid Rho.” This is hosted by our brothers at USC and the philanthropy aims to feed the homeless population of Downtown, Los Angeles while raising awareness for the homelessness epidemic in the area. This combined effort once produced 17,341 sandwiches in under one hour, breaking the Guinness world record at the same time. Since philanthropy is one of our main pillars, we make every attempt to be a positive influence in our community.</p>
