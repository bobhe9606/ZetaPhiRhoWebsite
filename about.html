                <p>Zeta Phi Rho was founded on August 10, 1995 at the California State University of Long Beach. A group of 14 individuals came together with a vision to create a diverse group of brothers who are committed to leadership, academics, the community, and character development. Since then, Zeta Phi Rho has expanded into 10 chapters across Southern California and counting. The chapter here at UCSB is currently the farthest, but that has not stopped us from strengthening our brotherhood with other schools through means of chapter-wide philanthropies, conventions, and social events. Our fraternity’s colors are traditionally navy blue and white. Such colors can be seen at chapter-wide meetings. </p>
