                    <p>Zeta Phi Rho was founded on August 10, 1995 at the California State University of Long Beach. A group of 14 individuals came together with a vision to create a diverse group of brothers who are committed to leadership, academics, the community, and character development. Since then, Zeta Phi Rho has expanded into 10 chapters across Southern California and counting. The chapter here at UCSB is currently the farthest, but that has not stopped us from strengthening our brotherhood with other schools through means of chapter-wide philanthropies, conventions, and social events. Our fraternity’s colors are traditionally navy blue and white. Such colors can be seen at chapter-wide meetings. </p>

            <p>Zeta Phi Rho at UCSB aims to help out the surrounding community through a multitude of events including beach clean-ups, helping out at IV Elementary School, and hosting fundraisers for a local issue. Our most recent fundraiser went to a non-profit organization that provides sanitary supplies to those in need in order to decrease the spread of COVID-19. There are also chapter-wide philanthropies that the fraternity annually hosts such as “Zeta Phi Skid Rho.” This is hosted by our brothers at USC and the philanthropy aims to feed the homeless population of Downtown, Los Angeles while raising awareness for the homelessness epidemic in the area. This combined effort once produced 17,341 sandwiches in under one hour, breaking the Guinness world record at the same time. Since philanthropy is one of our main pillars, we make every attempt to be a positive influence in our community. </p>

        <p>Being a brother of Zeta Phi Rho connects you to a network of brothers who will help support you in your personal, academic, and professional endeavors. Also, there will be opportunities within Zetas to develop a variety of skills through leadership and social opportunities. Zetas are more diverse than many other multicultural fraternities, known for being hospitable, and have a brotherhood that runs throughout all of Southern California. Although we may not have the biggest fraternity on campus, this allows us to form a tighter brotherhood.
